# any books, papers, online, or human resources that you used in developing the project
Stack Overflow for XML parsing and general questions. Code borrowed from Robert Duvall for pieces of XML parsing.
# files used to start the project (the class(es) containing main)
src/cellsociety_team18/Main.java
# files used to test the project
xml files may be modified to change parameters of each simulation. these files are under data/
# any data or resource files required by the project (including format of non-standard files)
All files under data (xml files specifying parameters for each simulation) and files under resources which specify user facing strings.
# any information about using the program (i.e., command-line/applet arguments, key inputs, interesting example data files, or easter eggs)
Once app is launched from Main, the UI is self explanatory. Click on the combo box to select a simulation, and the respective grid will pop up in place of the text. Click Start to begin the simulation. If you wish to speed up the simulation, enter a smaller delay time in ms. If you wish to pause the simulation, click Stop. Clicking Start will start the simulation back up again. If you wish to step through the simulation, pause it, then click Step. If you wish to restart the simulation with a new random distribution according to the parameters specified in the xml file, click Reload. If you wish to load a new simulation, select the desired simulation from the combo box, and it will load on your click. If you wish to change the grid size, enter a positive number into Grid Size.
# any known bugs, crashes, or problems with the project's functionality
Project is fully functional.
# any extra features included in the project
Some extra features are described above under information. These include changing the grid size on user input and shuffling the grid on user input.
# your impressions of the assignment to help improve it in the future
This was a fun assignment and was a good team work experience.
